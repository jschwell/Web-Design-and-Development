					<h2>What is SEO?</h2>
					<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of designing a website so that it ranks higher in search engines. SEO makes it easier for a search engine to crawl and index content. Search engines crawl sites by sending an automated search bot to search through a site via links. The bot then stores that information in a database to be recalled during searches. Overall, optimizing your website will help improve rankings, drive traffic, and gain recognition.</p>

					<h2>Why is SEO important?</h2>
					<p>The biggest reason SEO is important is to drive traffic to a website. The majority of traffic now comes from search engines. If a website is not setup for SEO, search engines may not be able to find the site or add it to their databases. Therefore, the website will miss out on gaining traffic and that traffic will most likely go to their competitors instead. The higher in rank a website can achieve, the more likely it will be receive traffic. The top three spots on the first page are the most commonly clicked and they receive more traffic than results further down on the page. Overall, web developers who perform SEO will have an advantage in gaining traffic and customers over those who do not perform SEO.</p>

					<h2>Techniques</h2>
					<p>One technique that web developers can use is to include page titles by using the title tag. The title tag tells both users and search engines what the page is about. Overall, creating a good title tag will help a page be more noticeable in search results and attract visitors to a site. Here are some tips to follow to make the best title tag for SEO:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Every page should have a unique title that accurately describes the page's content</li>
                        <li>Search engines typically display the first 65 characters of a title tag so it is a good idea to stick to this limit</li>
                        <li>Important key words should be close to front of the title tag</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Another good technique is to use the meta description tag. The meta description tag gives the user a summary of what the page is about. A web developer can use the following advice to make a good meta description tag:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>The description should be relevant and unique to the page</li>
                        <li>It can be used as a snippet in search results so the summary should be eye-catching</li>
                        <li>The description should use important keywords
	                        <ul>
	                        	<li>Search engines will bold these keywords in the description and it can draw a higher click-through rate to the page</li>
	                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Search engines typically display the first 160 characters so it is good to stay within this limit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Writing simple to understand URLs is another  technique. A well-written URL will result in better crawling by search engines as well as a higher page ranking. URLs are also displayed in search results so they can impact click-through. By using the following guidelines for URLS, a web developer can improve their siteâ€™s rank:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>A URL should be short so it is easier for users to remember and share</li>
                        <li>A URL should contain keywords because it provides more insight on what the page is about</li>
                        <li>Static URLs are preferable over dynamic URLs
		                    <ul>
		                    	<li>Dynamic parameters can result in lower overall ranking and indexing</li>
		                    </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Each page should have one version of a URL
	                        <ul>
	                        	<li>A 301 redirect should be implemented if multiple URLs are being used to reach the same page</li>
	                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Hyphens should be used to separate words in URLs since not all web applications accurately interpret other separators</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One last technique is to use the webmaster tools provided by search engines. These tools can help identify SEO issues within a site. If these issues are addressed, the site can perform better in search results. A web developer can also use these tools to make sure the pages they are building are visible to search engines. Overall, webmaster tools give the web developer better control of how search engines interact with their website.</p>
