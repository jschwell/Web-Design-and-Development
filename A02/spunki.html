					<h2>What part or parts of the reading did you find surprising?</h2>
					<p>I was surprised that the attribute value in HTML5 doesn't have to be enclosed in quotation marks as long as the value doesn't have spaces. I would assume that all coding would be made consistant. I plan to keep on using the quotation marks for all attributes as the books suggests.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="puzzling" class="tab-content">
					<h2>What part or parts of the reading are still puzzling to you?</h2>
					<p>The one part I found puzzling was Aptana's HTML5 validator. I used both W3C's validator and Aptana's validator as suggested by the book. While my web page had no errors or warnings on W3C's validator, I had two warnings on Aptana's validator. I noticed that the two warnings were actually not warnings at all but the information about the page. I understand that Aptana uses a different validator but I am confused as to why it would count the information as warnings.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="useful" class="tab-content">
					<h2>What part or parts of the reading did you find useful enough to want to incorporate its concepts?</h2>
					<p>One of the parts I found useful are the code comments. Comments will be useful for marking when a certain element starts and ends. They will also be helpful for testing layouts of an element by commenting out various code.</p>
                    <p>Another part I found useful are the validation tools. The validation tools will be helpful in finding any errors such as a missing closing tag or missing quotation marks.</p>
                    <p>I found the outline feature in Aptana to be the most useful. I would find it very helpful when trying to navigate through larger web pages. I can easily click the section I want versus scrolling through the entire document, only to miss the section I was looking for.</p>
					<div class="side-content">
                    	<h3>Useful Links</h3>
                    	<ul>
                    		<li><a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">HTML5 Validator</a></li>
                    		<li><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator" target="_blank">CSS3 Validator</a></li>
                    	</ul>
                	</div>
				</section>
				<section id="new" class="tab-content">
					<h2>What part or parts of the reading was totally new to you?</h2>
					<p>I was unaware that whitespace adds to the size of the file. In the past I've used many spaces as a way of keeping my content organized. However, now that I know it will increase my file size, I will limit the amount of whitespace used.</p>
                    <p>Another new concept was Aptana. I have used Dreamweaver for quite some time but my current version is out of date. I have been looking for a good software to replace it since Adobe is now doing subscriptions. While Aptana may not have as many features as Dreamweaver, it is free and has most of the features I use often.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="knew-it" class="tab-content">
					<h2>What part or parts of the reading did you already know? Did the reading increase your knowledge on
the topic?</h2>
					<p>Since I started to teach myself code back in 2008, I knew a lot about this chapter. I have become quite familiar with the code structure and the basic layout of a web page. However, I did not know the formal names for certain parts of the code such as the document tree.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="interesting" class="tab-content">
					<h2>What part or parts of the reading did you find interesting?</h2>
					<p>I found it interesting that an id attribute is used to uniquely identify one element while a class attribute can be used on multiple elements. A few times when viewing a site's source code, I saw the code use the id attribute the same way as the class attribute. The website did not use the id to identify one element but many elements.</p>
