					<h2>Origin</h2>
					<p>Much as the name suggests, the Norwegian Elkhound originated in Norway. However, while their name suggests that they hunted elk, this is actually a mistranslation. The original name is “norsk elghund” where elghund actually translates to moose dog. Although they were primarily used to hunt moose, they were also used to hunt other animals, including bear.</p>
					<p>According to Norse sagas, Elkhounds traveled with the Vikings and even went out to sea with them on voyages. Elkhounds were also used as farm dogs where they protected the farm from predators and served as companions and watch dogs to their owners.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="types-of-elkhound">
					<h2>Types of Elkhound</h2>
					<p>There are two types of Elkhound used for hunting, the Bandhund and the Loshund.</p>
					<h3>Bandhund</h3>
					<p>The Bandhund is attached to the hunter by a long line. Its purpose is to lead the hunter to the animal by tracking its scent.</p>
					<h3>Loshund</h3>
					<p>The Loshund tracks ahead and locates the animal. It will bark to alert the hunter and will keep the animal at bay by jumping all around the animal until the hunter arrives.</p>
					<p>Neither type is used to kill the animal, however. They are just used for locating.</p>

					<p>While the Elkhound has been around for quite some time, the Elkhound wasn't exhibited in dog shows until the Norwegian Hunters Association held its first show in 1877. Afterwards, records and stud books were established and breed standards were put into place. The dog, Gamle Bamse Gram, set the standard for the Norwegian Elkhound and looks very similar to those we see today.</p>
					<p>Norwegian Elkhounds were brought to England and America shortly thereafter.</p>

				<section id="akc">
					<h2>American Kennel Club</h2>
				<p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1913. The breed currently ranks as the 100th most popular dog breed.</p>
				<h3>Norwegian Elkhound Association of America</h3>
				<p>The Norwegian Elkhound Association of America (NEAA) was accepted by AKC in 1935. The purpose of the organization is to provide information about the breed and to aid and encourage responsible breeding.</p>

				<p>The Norwegian Elkhound is still being used to hunt moose and other big game in Norway. These hunts may even last an entire day.</p>
