					<h2>Tips</h2>
					<p>If you get your Elkhound as a puppy, start training it right away. Puppies are perfectly capable of soaking up information, even at 8 weeks. You’ll want to keep your training sessions short and fun, especially at a younger age.</p>
					<p>You’ll want to think of all the behaviors that you won’t want your puppy to do as an adult. A puppy jumping on you may be cute but you wouldn’t want a full grown dog jumping up on you or other people. No matter how cute the puppy may be, you do not want to encourage these bad behaviors at a young age.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="techniques">
					<h2>Training Techniques</h2>
					<p>While training your Elkhound, never use harsh training techniques or physical punishment. Hardly any breed responds well to those and you’ll end up with a dog that doesn’t trust you or doesn’t want to be around you. Elkhounds are a sensitive breed and will be able to pick up on your attitude. If you’re upset by their behavior, they’ll sense it.</p>
					<p>You’ll want to train your Elkhound with a lot of praise and rewards for good behavior. You’ll still want to let your Elkhound know in some way if their behavior is unacceptable, however. You can let him know through tone of voice, expression, or you can even ignore him. For example, when their owner comes home, some dogs get really excited, whine, and will even jump up on their owner. Instead of giving the dog love and attention right away, you will want to ignore them until they settle down.  As soon as they exhibit calm behavior, give them all the attention that they deserve.</p>
					<p>Elkhounds are highly food motivated so be sure to keep stocked up on treats. However, do not let them see the treat beforehand. If an Elkhound sees the treat beforehand, you’ll find that they won’t want to do anything until they see the treat. I had this experience myself. I tried to get my Elkhound mix to shake but he would just give me a blank stare. However, if I went to go get a treat, he couldn’t give me his paw any faster.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="socialization">
					<h2>Socialization</h2>
					<p>It is very important that you socialize your puppy immediately. Socialization will help your Elkhound become a well-rounded dog. You’ll want your Elkhound to get used to a variety of new experiences, sites, and noises. Here are some things you can do to help socialize your Elkhound:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Invite family and friends over regularly</li>
						<li>Introduce your Elkhound to children (Make sure they are being monitored)</li>
						<li>Take your Elkhound to both regular parks and dog parks</li>
						<li>Take your Elkhound to stores that allow dogs, such as PetSmart</li>
						<li>Have your Elkhound meet your neighbors</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="professional">
					<h2>Professional Training</h2>
					<p>You can always teach your Elkhound good behavior by attending training sessions. Some places recommend group sessions but I prefer individual sessions. Similar to people, each dog is different when it comes to learning and I feel you will get the best experience if you work one-on-one with a trainer to meet your dog’s needs.</p>
					<p>Group sessions also typically require certain vaccines that your puppy may not receive until they are 4 months of age.</p>
					<p>There are also many trainers out there. I would suggest doing a search for local trainers in your area and reading up on each. Check out a trainer’s philosophy and see if it matches your own when it comes to training your dog.</p>
