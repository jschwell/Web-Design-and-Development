					<h2>Find a Shelter/Rescue Group</h2>
					<p>Trying to find all the shelters and rescue groups in your area can be time consuming. Luckily, there are two good sites that search nearby shelters/rescue groups for you, <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/">PetFinder</a> and <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com/">Adopt a Pet</a>. I personally prefer Petfinder as you can better customize your search but both sites are good to explore. One site may show results the other does not.</p>
					<p>Both sites also offer searches to find individual shelters and rescue groups.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.petfinder.com/animal-shelters-and-rescues/search" title="Petfinder Shelter/Rescue Search">Petfinder Shelter/Rescue Search</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.adoptapet.com/animal-shelters" title="Adopt a Pet Shelter/Rescue Search">Adopt a Pet Shelter/Rescue Search</a></li>

				<section id="questions">
					<h2>Questions to Ask</h2>
					<p>Just like with breeders, you should always ask questions to find out more about your future pet.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the dog's personality like?</li>
						<li>How old is the dog?</li>
						<li>What is the dog's energy level?</li>
						<li>Is the dog house-trained?</li>
						<li>Does the dog get along with other animals?</li>
						<li>How does the dog act around various people such as the staff/foster parents, visitors, and children?</li>
						<li>Has the dog ever snapped at anyone or shown any aggressive behavior to their knowledge?</li>
						<li>Does the dog have any known health issues?</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Shelter vs Rescue Group</h2>
					<p>You may be wondering if it's better to get a dog from a shelter or a rescue group. It's a different experience for everyone, but here's what you can commonly expect at each place.</p>
					<p>Overall, your dog/puppy will be up-to-date on shots and neutered/spayed no matter if you get it from a shelter or rescue group.</p>
					<h3>Shelters</h3>
					<p>At a shelter, you will go through an interview process once you have picked out your dog/puppy. If the interviewer deems you fit for the dog/puppy, you will get to take your dog/puppy home that day.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Rescue Groups</h3>
					<p>If you go through a rescue group, you will have to fill out an online application for the dog/puppy you want. Next, your application will be read over by the staff and you will be notified if they find your application acceptable. Next, you will set up a meeting with the foster parent to meet the dog/puppy. If you are set on that dog/puppy, they will set up a home interview. If the home interview goes well, you will then get your dog/puppy.</p>
					<p>While the process sounds tedious, the advantage to getting a dog/puppy from a rescue is that the foster parent can provide you with more information about the dog/puppy than a shelter can.</p>
