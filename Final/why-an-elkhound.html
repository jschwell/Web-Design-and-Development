				<p>Before you decide on becoming the owner of a Norwegian Elkhound, you should see if its temperament and characteristics match your lifestyle. Do you travel often? Do you work long hours? Do other activities keep you occupied? Overall, do you have the time to give this dog the love and attention he deserves? If you don’t have the time to develop a strong bond, neither you nor the dog will get as much out of the relationship as you should.</p>
				<p>If you’re a first time dog owner, you will want to do your research and use any information that this website provides. As you will see, an Elkhound can be quite the challenge, as will most dogs, for someone who is inexperienced.</p>
				<p>However, this is a great dog for experienced owners. If you can give this breed the attention and exercise it needs, it will be a very rewarding experience. There have been many Elkhound owners that wouldn’t consider owning anything but this breed because of the great bond that you can develop.</p>

					<h2>Temperament</h2>
					<p>Just like people, every dog has its own personality. Breeding and how the dog is raised often plays a part in the dog’s temperament. However, here are a few things you can expect out of your Norwegian Elkhound.</p>
					<p>The Elkhound is often bold, energetic, and independent. They thrive on attention, are normally very friendly, and are very loyal. They will greet their family members and prior acquaintances with much enthusiasm and are very devoted to their family. Because they are so people-oriented, they do not like to be shut away from their family so they are best to have as an indoor dog.</p>
					<p>The breed gets along well with children and makes for a good playmate. Just note that no dog is automatically good with children. It all depends on how they are socialized. If you get an older Elkhound, the dog will need time to adjust around children if it was not socialized properly as a puppy.</p>
					<p>As with any dog, make sure you teach your child how to approach and touch dogs. Your child should not approach a dog while it is sleeping or eating and they should definitely not take the dog’s food away. Overall, make sure your child does not tease or mistreat a dog. Mistreating a dog can cause the child to get bitten and unfortunately, the dog often suffers the consequences for the child misbehaving. Lastly, always supervise the interactions between your Elkhound and child. No matter how friendly your Elkhound, or any dog, may be, it is never a good idea to leave them unattended.</p>
					<p>Thanks to their history as a hunting dog, they tend to bark a lot. You will need to be prepared to teach them when it is okay to bark and when to stop. However, this, along with the breed’s loyalty, makes them great watch dogs. They will bark to alert you of anyone approaching the home or of any intruders. Their deep bark and bear-like appearance will also make intruders think twice about entering the premises.</p>
					<p>While they make great watch dogs, they are not guaranteed to be great guard dogs. Because of their friendly personality, they may make friends with the intruder instead of scaring them out of the house. However, if the intruder shows any aggression towards the dog’s family members, the Elkhound will do what it takes to protect its family. The breed was meant to face large prey so it will show no fear towards the aggressor.</p>
					<p>Overall, an Elkhound is an extremely loyal dog who will provide wonderful friendship and will always be there to protect its family.</p>

				<section id="energy">
					<h2>Energy</h2>
					<p>Elkhounds are fairly active dogs and need daily exercise as do many other breeds. Elkhounds were bred to be working dogs so they won’t be a couch potato, at least not until they have received their exercise for the day. Exercise is also important for many breeds in order to keep their weight down. The Elkhound is no exception especially because they are food motivated dogs.</p>
					<p>Typically plan to exercise your Elkhound for 20 to 30 minutes twice a day. They enjoy hiking, long walks, or even trotting next to you while bicycling. They also perform well in multiple dog sports including, agility, obedience, rally, carting, flyball, freestyle, herding, and tracking.</p>
					<p>If you aren’t willing to spend the time to exercise your dog, don’t be surprised if you come home to a mess. If they don’t get that energy out, they will expel it by chewing up anything they can get their paws on.</p>

				<section id="health">
					<h2>Health</h2>
					<p>Norwegian Elkhounds are typically a healthy breed and do not have the number of health problems that are present in many other breeds. While only a few Elkhounds will get one of these, it’s always good to know what to expect so you can get your dog the treatment it needs before things get too serious. Here are the common diseases that can occur in this breed.</p>
					<section class="table-container">
					<table>
						<caption><h3>Common Diseases</h3></caption>

								<th id="hdr_disdesc" scope="col">Description</th>

								<td headers="hdr_disease">Hip dysplasia</td>
								<td headers="hdr_disdesc">A malformation of the hip joint that may cause severe pain and lameness. Treated with anti-inflammatory medication or surgery.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td headers="hdr_disease">Progressive retinal atrophy<br>(PRA)</td>
								<td headers="hdr_disdesc">The gradual deterioration of the retina. Dogs with PRA typically start off night-blind then start to lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. There is no treatment for PRA and most dogs that have it become blind. However, it is painless and dogs usually adapt well given that their surroundings stay the same.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td headers="hdr_disease">Hypothyroidism</td>
								<td headers="hdr_disdesc">A disorder of the thyroid gland where it does not produce enough thyroid hormones. Treated with medication and diet.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td headers="hdr_disease">Fanconi syndrome</td>
								<td headers="hdr_disdesc">A disease that affects the kidneys where the kidneys are unable to properly absorb nutrients and electrolytes. It can be treated but not cured through medication and diet.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td headers="hdr_disease">Sebaceous cysts</td>
								<td headers="hdr_disdesc">Cysts that form under a dog’s skin. Treated by surgical removal.</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</section>
					<p>Many breeds have some of these diseases as well and just remember, only some Elkhounds will get these. A responsible breeder will have a health certificate showing that their bloodline has been cleared of these diseases, limiting the chances of your puppy developing one.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="grooming">
					<h2>Grooming</h2>
					<p>Norwegian Elkhounds are not difficult to groom and just require the standard grooming and care all dogs need. However, this breed does shed a lot. If you value a clean house and won’t tolerate tufts of hair around the house, you may want to look at another breed.</p>

				<section id="training">
					<h2>Training</h2>
					<p>For the most part, Norwegian Elkhounds are moderately easy to train. However, they require a firm and consistent owner or else they will walk all over you.</p>
